# Select

*Styleable select elements*

Select is a Javascript and CSS library for creating styleable select elements.
Unlike many other select-replacements, Select is designed from the ground up to replicate the behavior of native select controls as much as is possible, providing a seemless experience for users.
That means it works properly when you type characters, use tab for focus, etc.

Use Select where you would use a native select.
It doesn't, and will never, provide any sort of autocomplete functionality, so you probably don't want to use it on a list of more than a few hundred elements.
